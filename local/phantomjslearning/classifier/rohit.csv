http://haveababy.com/fertility-information/ivf-authority/birth-control-pill-ivf-using-agonist-andor-antagonist-protocols,"my approach is consistently to use a long pituitary dr protocol with an agonist, coming off 1-2 months on the bcp. the latter is intended to lower lh and thereby reduce stromal activation (hyperthecosis) in the hope of controlling ovarian androgen release. i then stimulate with low dosage fshr to which i add a smidgeon of lh/hcg (luveris/menopur) from the 3rd day and watch for the # of follicles and [e2] starting on the 7th day of cos. if there are > 25 follicles, i keep stimulating (regardless of the [e2] until 50% of all follicles reach 14mm. then, provided the [e2] is >2500pg/ml, i stop the agonist and the gonadotropin stimulation and follow the e2 (only) daily, without doing further us examinations. the [e2] will almost invariably climb and i watch it go up (regardless of how high the concentration of e2reaches) and track it coming down again. as soon as the [e2] drops below 2500pg/ml (and not before then ever), i administer 10,000u hcgu or hcgf (ovidrel/ovitrel-500mcg) as the trigger and perform an egg retrieval 36h later. icsi is a must because coasted eggs usually have no cumulus oophoris and eggs without a cumulus will not readily fertilize on their own. all fertilized eggs are cultured to blastocyst (up to 6 days). and up to two (2) are transferred transvaginally under us guidance.",3,0
