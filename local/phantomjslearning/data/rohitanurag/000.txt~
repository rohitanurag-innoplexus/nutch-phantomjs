Indian Education System: What needs to really change?

So before we talk about education reform needed in India , we should have to reform the mentality of parents who want to see their child securing nothing less than the top slot. Also we always talk about the reformation required in education system but what about the poor infrastructure and very poor quality of faculties that we currently have? In my opinion the only drawback in our education system is that it fails to recognize talent at early stage i.e if someone is good in some kind of sports that sports should be made his main subject along with other basic courses.

Primary education is just like the strong pillars which support the whole building. Just imagine how would it be if pillars were made with adulterated and poor quality concrete? Guys same is the case with all of us and primary school students. We should atleast thank God for where we are today. Let me tell you there are millions of innocent little eyes which are still deprived of this basic necessity of education – The pillar for their bright future. Also many parents in rural areas don’t even bother to send their children to school except some who do it for just having them get free mid day meals.These million little ones don’t even have dreams because dreams are created only when you know your role models and it is possible when we can atleast read and write.

Coming to higher education now, many of you reading this article are engineers or going to get conferred upon the degree of engineering. Adding some masala to the topic, this engineering degree must be like a Bharat ratna for most of you or you can say a paid Bharat ratna because many of you are on the mercy of your parents who work their ass-off day and night paying the fees in multiple lakhs. Let me ask you who is an engineer? Have anyone of you thought about the meaning of engineer? Engineer is a person who solves the current technical problem prevailing in the society and making our society better off than earlier. He/She uses his/her artistic imagination and power to look beyond horizon in solving the problem. I can guarantee not even one of you must have thought like this.

Some days ago even I was having the same thinking. It’s true many of us are studying engineering just for the sake of landing in a cosy job and a handsome salary, even I believe the same way. But have you ever thought that we are doing nothing but just following the rat race to reach the top. What would you all be 10 years down the line? Atleast we all have to change our thinking. The reason I taunted about getting an engineer’s degree is that we will all be bored and frustrated in 10 years with our profession. We should keep doing side by side the things which we love and also follow our dream. I know its late now for all of us but we still have some time to correct our course of path and follow that which heart chose without even caring what others might think or say.

At last coming to the responsibility of Government of India in reforming education sector. We all know the education policies are made at the top in Raisina Hills, New Delhi. Sometimes the reforms are too good and also the intention of Government but what hinders it is the implementation and its reach to the grassroot levels of rural India. Also GOI should increase the annual spendings on education and R&D. Currently its 2-3% of total GDP of India which is approx 3 percent less than most of our rival counterparts like China, Russia and the US. Spending more on the education and skill development reforms now will eventually generate more GDPs in the long term and wouldn’t be good for the country and its people?

Above mentioned views are my personal one.Thank you for reading it.I don’t have any intent to hurt anyone’s feeling because I know I have used a lot of sarcasm in the article.

Thank You

Yours
