A HALF-FILLED FOUNTAIN PEN

A 10 year old boy named Hari during his school days used to regularly see their elders and teachers with a “Much hyped instrument of writing among their classmates”- A Pen. For any student of his age using a pen always remained an activity that they can boast off.

Hari came from a middle class family and was enrolled as a student in a renowned English medium school of the town. Being a shy boy with a poor academic past records he never got himself placed in the top 20 students of the class who were ranked by the school administration on the basis of student’s academic proficiency. It was that time when everyone were permitted strictly to use only pencil as a medium of writing. No one were allowed to use a pen. But as we know there always remain some radical elements in the society, some of Hari’s friends brought pens to the school and used it to display their dominance over whole class. Hari used to watch them daily with envy.

One day he strongly pleaded his father to buy him a pen. The moment his father heard him, he scolded him very angrily and told him its not good to use a pen at this age because school doesn’t allows him and also his handwriting would take a deep toll if he suddenly start using it. He said for his son’s better only. Hari cried a lot that day. Seeing his son crying he quickly took him in his shoulder with both of his hands and whispered in his ear “Look son I will not allow you to have it now but I promise you that one day I will myself only take you to buy a fountain pen (Not ball Point because a fountain pen helps in maintaining your previous handwriting during transition from pencil) and focus your mind more on studies than these all unimportant things ”.He kissed him on his forehead and let him go .

A few years later when Hari got admission into 6th standard, he took the pledge to come under top 10 rank of the class because he still remembered the encounter he had with his father earlier. At the end of the year he proved everyone that he is too capable of getting a good score. He got 7th rank position in the class. As soon as he got this news he became elated with joy and excited too to inform their parent. That day his father hugged him tightly and immediately took him in his vintage scooter to the nearest stationary shop. For his father buying a pen was nothing a great deal but for Hari it was like dream come true.

Soon Hari came under the good eyes of their teachers and elders and also got lauded for his little achievement. It was the first milestone of success for him. He easily didn’t got this success. He went into depressions a lot of times, failed in many subjects with red marks on his report card during his previous years but the positive thing about him was he never gave up and every time he felled down he rose up with much more courage and will power. The true source of inspiration for him was his father’s promise .He worked hard continuously in spite of many failures in his way. From that day onwards he kept that pen as a priceless gift and preserved it for whole of his life.

So You can see how A Half Filled Fountain Pen brought in him a huge change in the attitude towards his goals. Everything in this world is beautiful. One needs to learn to see things in a positive way and use it to take the maximum benefit they can. There is latent potential in everything surrounding us , it might be living or non-living. Also it is truly said there is no alternative to success without hardwork , motivation and a strong will power.

Reason for the title to be named Half-filled fountain pen because a fountain pen works best when the ink inside it is half filled .  The pressure from the ink cartridge column gets lowered due to less height of the ink column (Halved) and the ink flows smoothly to the bottom. It also prevents possibility of ink overflow.

nice… refreshens many childhood memories. I remember how much I wanted to take a pen to school and flaunt it to other students. I do not remember much about a fountain pen but a ball pen feels the best when its about to finish (the tip is smoothened by prolonged use, and my hand gets habitual of its grip).
