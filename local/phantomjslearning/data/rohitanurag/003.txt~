Law Of Reciprocating

Getting on the scientific notes we all learnt during 8 or 9 class Newton’s Laws of motion and among them the third one was most important “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction”.Don’t get bored beacuse I am going to keep this blog small with some fruitful conclusion.So there is always an opposite reaction in real life too.It’s the philosophy of life.

I will now share with you all an incident which happened with me.The time was around 6 pm at the arrival section of Delhi Airport.I just landed here from Bangalore and was heading to my mausaji’s home near Palam Airforce Base.The distance from airport to the home was no too much.I decided to book a taxi for my travel.Even for a small distance the price asked from me was around 270 rupees.I got astonished to hear the price from the taxi booth officials.

I dont know what hapened to me at that moment I decided to use a fickle idea and contacted one more passenger to book the same taxi so that each individuals price becomes less.We got only one receipt of the taxi booking and the another passenger kept it with himself.After that I reached the home safely but due to my mistake I forgot to take one of my duffle bag kept in the luggage compartment of taxi.I too also didn’t have the taxi receipt with me .It was an embarassing moment for me as it was almost impossible to find the taxi without the car number and driver’s phone number.I regretted a lot afterwards.The bag costed me around Rs 5000.

It was a learning experience for me.The law of reciprocating prevails allover.If you do something good you will get a good reward afterwards and same for bad also.It was a bad reward and day for me .
