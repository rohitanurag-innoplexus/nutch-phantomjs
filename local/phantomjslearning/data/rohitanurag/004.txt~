The Grapes of Happiness

Happiness is a mental or emotional state of well-being characterized by positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy. Though the definition on the Wikipedia page might try to elaborate the term HAPPINESS in a proper way but still its not perfect

It’s a state where one gets more inclined to chose a thorn worn paths rather than a smooth red carpeted one.It’s a state one feels when he does things in an unconventional way different from others.With technological revolution taking place in India the perspective of most of the Indians are changing in a disastrous way.For them happiness means comfort,leisure,sex,money,self-respect,tension free life,etc.

I am now asking you a serious but a legitimate question. Have you ever came out of your comfort zone and lived atleast one day of your life for others?Happiness is not in bringing it to yourself but in bringing to others though it may cost yours .Have you ever seen in the innocent eyes of any poor children who cannot afford a 2 meal per day ? No naa ? See in their eyes if you have some time.You will find the real meaning of happiness inscribed in their innocent eyes.We might think always to complete our dreams but who will think for them , they also have some  , they also belongs to a human race with a beating heart.

Have you ever accepted the mistakes you have done in your life which might have hurted someone deeply ? I have accepted that and that brings me a happiness . Have you ever tried to sort out complications with someone which you had somedays ago rather than to make it more complex? I have done that and it too brings me happiness . For some of them it might look odd but bowing your head down and having a heart for everyone is all about happiness

I have decided which course of path to take in lyf – The path filled with struggle and only struggle . Have you decided ? This blog might change some of your mindsets.Though little helpful ,  it might create an awareness among Indian youths of 21st generation .

There is a poem which I can recall I read it in class 7 -THE ROAD NOT TAKEN .Its from Robert Frost ,many of you might remember this .I am sharing it down below

    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    And sorry I could not travel both
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    And looked down one as far as I could
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;

     

    Then took the other, as just as fair,
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    Though as for that the passing there
    Had worn them really about the same,

     

    And both that morning equally lay
    In leaves no step had trodden black.
    Oh, I kept the first for another day!
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way.

     

    I doubted if I should ever come back.

    I shall be telling this with a sigh

    Somewhere ages and ages hence:
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
    I took the one less traveled by,
    And that has made all the difference.
